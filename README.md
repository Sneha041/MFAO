An analysis on manufacturing machine failures and optimization using replacement year prediction
The manufacturing sector incorporates the creation of items utilizing a range of tools and machinery. However, production delays and higher expenses may result from equipment malfunctions along the production line. Reducing manufacturing failures has emerged as a critical component of manufacturing processes in order to manage these risks. In this study, I analyze the failure rate of production lines and suggest a Python program for reducing manufacturing defects. The number of production lines and the number of failures for each line are entered into the program. The failure rate overall and per production line are then calculated. This research allows the program to pinpoint production lines with high failure rates so they may be improved. The program also uses replacement theory from optimization approaches to further optimize the production process. The program will determine the replacement year for equipment in production lines with a high failure rate based on the entry of the company's founding year. This lowers the possibility of failure and enables prompt machine replacement. Manufacturers can reduce downtime and costs related to machine failures by proactively identifying and improving production lines with high failure rates by implementing this program. Additionally, applying replacement theory enables the creation of a machine maintenance strategy that is more effective financially. For manufacturers wishing to streamline their production procedures and boost overall productivity, this program is a useful tool.
